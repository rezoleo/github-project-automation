# GitHub project automation

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that automates your GitHub Project by adding new
> issues and PRs

## Installation

Install the GitHub app or create a new one (TODO), then create a `.github/github-project-automation.yml` file with the following content:
```yaml
project: "Name of your project (mandatory)"

# The rest of the configuration is optional
issues:
  column: "Column to send issues to (default 'To do')"
pullRequests:
  columnDraft: "Column to send Draft PRs to (default 'In progress')"
  column: "Column to send PRs to (default 'Review in progress')"
```

The app will then automatically add any new issue or PR to the configured project.

Note: only repository projects are supported at the moment, support for organization projects is planned.

## Deployment
